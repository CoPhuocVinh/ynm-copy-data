3. [ ] Create end-to-end tests for complete data flow scenarios
4. [ ] Implement contract tests between producer and consumer services
5. [ ] Add performance tests for high-load scenarios
6. [ ] Implement test fixtures and factories for test data generation
7. [ ] Set up test coverage reporting and minimum coverage thresholds
8. [ ] Create mocks for external dependencies to enable isolated testing
9. [ ] Implement snapshot testing for DTOs and entities
10. [ ] Add automated API tests for any HTTP endpoints

## Documentation
